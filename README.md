# fileshadow
A mathematical algorithm designed to hide files within other files using advanced cryptographic techniques.

### Note of Caution
Fileshadow is primarily a transformation algorithm rather than a traditional encryption algorithm. While data is altered based on a combination of parameters that form the secret key, it is not intended to provide flawless security on its own. The transformation operates on intrinsic and positional values of input. For secure data protection, it is strongly recommended to pair Fileshadow with a strong encryption algorithm like AES or any of the latest symmetric encryption standards. You may consider using Fileshadow to hide an already encrypted file, consequently obfuscating its existence.
